This is Hockey Game Data analysis.
There are two data files. One has a condensed event set from a randomly chosen hockey game and the other contains Expected Goals values (xg) provided only for shots that successfully hit the net. If an xg value doesn't correspond to a shot event, it should not be counted.

Here we analyze the data and tried to find out the facts below.

>Who won the game & what was the score?
>Who won the Expected Goals (xg) battle & what was each team's total xg?
>What do these two answers tell us about how the two teams played?
>Which possessionid had the highest total successful passes? 
>How many successful passes were there and why do this specific possession had so many?
>Using the event data provided along with x/y coordinate columns,  identify the likely xCoord of each blueline.
>Create a scatter plot for shots by each teams and those are converted into goal.
>What is highest xg among the goals that were scored and why it was such high?
>Did this goal have a shot assist?
